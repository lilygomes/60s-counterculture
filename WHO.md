## The Hippies

A generation of young Baby Boomers disillusioned with consumerism, materialism, and warfare chose to buck the system that birthed them. They eschewed the traditional values that their parents espoused in search of greater truth. The nation’s youth embraced nonconformity; hair grew long, showers were skipped, and clothes were baggy and tie—dyed—if they were worn at all. These were the hippies, a group based on the ideas of breaking the traditions of American society and living life without rigid structures. Hippies powered the counterculture movement of the 60s, quite literally countering the mass culture of modern America.
