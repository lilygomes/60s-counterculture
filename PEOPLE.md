The Beat Generation of the 1940s and 50s led the way for 1960s hippies; writers like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs criticized societal beliefs and values in their work and promoted self expression. Some of the most well-known icons of the counterculture movement of the 60s were musicians, as the beliefs of the movement carried through in their music. Musicians like The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, and Stevie Wonder all played a large role in leading the youth culture with the messages in their music. Altogether, the movement was more of a cultural shift rather than an organized group. The movement was defined by the many different people who took partâ€“the students, the artists, the musicians, and more.
