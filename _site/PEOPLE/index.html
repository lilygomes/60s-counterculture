<h2 id="writers">Writers</h2>
<p>The Beat Generation of the 1940s and 50s led the way for 1960s hippies; writers like Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and William S. Burroughs criticized societal beliefs and values in their work and promoted self expression. Their work spread the core tenets of the movement to the nation’s youth. Kerouac’s novel <em>On the Road</em> were based on his own experiences traveling with friends across the United States, and well modeled the search for self-determination and free transience that became popular across the country. On its surface, Ken Kesey’s novel <em>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</em> was about a group that staged a revolution in their psychiatric ward, but deeper down, it conveyed themes of anti-establishment resistance and individualism amongst oppression. Through the counterculture era, many writers made works embodying the ideas of the movement.</p>

<h2 id="musicians">Musicians</h2>
<p>Some of the most well-known icons of the counterculture movement of the 60s were musicians, as the beliefs of the movement carried through in their music. Musicians like The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Stevie Wonder all played a large role in leading the youth culture with the messages in their music. Altogether, the movement was more of a cultural shift rather than an organized group. The movement was defined by the many different people who took part–the students, the artists, the musicians, and more.</p>
