## Goals of the Movement

The ultimate goals of the counterculture movement were to subvert conventional institutions, embrace self expression, and create a society based on peace and love. Their protests often aimed to fight for civil rights and criticize the useless harm that the Vietnam War was causing. As a whole, they were against materialism, militarism, technology, and capitalism. They eschewed their forefathers’ mainstream ideals for lives of sexual freedom, mind-opening drugs, and nonconformist looks.

## Nonviolence

Hippies opposed warfare, protesting against the nation’s involvement in the Vietnam War. Often, they used peaceful methods for protesting. Peace and love were general values of the movement, almost becoming a lifestyle philosophy for hippies.

## Mind Over Matter

The hippies of the counterculture movement pushed up against the rigid ideologies of traditional American society, putting great emphasis on individual thought and the power of the mind. This was evident in the popularity of eastern religions, primarily Zen Buddhism. Hippies lost faith in the sacrifice, pain, and servitude that popular Abrahamic religions—primarily Christianity—espoused. Instead, they chose religions that emphasized self-reflection and meditation to overcome life’s burdens.

Psychoactive drugs played a large role in this movement as well. Cannabis was popular for its euphoric and pleasurable feeling, which fit the easygoing “free pleasure” mindset of hippies. Though its properties were discovered in 1943, the 60s saw a boom in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide—better known as LSD, or just “acid”. Through expanding research by psychologists and scientists around the world, LSD made its way out of the lab and onto the tongues of hippies across the United States. Its powerful hallucinogenic, mind-expanding properties made it popular with those seeking new ways to expand their minds.

## Going Their Own Way

A formal education and a job at a desk was not for hippies. The counterculture movement saw a rise in college dropouts and workplace resignations. Hippies aimed to break free of a system that they saw as constraining; they valued a peaceful lifestyle over a conforming one. In general, they did not place as much value on conventional institutions as their predecessors had. Communes, or shared living spaces without private property, became popular as an alternative to a conventional way of living.
